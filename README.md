# Experimenting with Data Sets

Welcome to this repository, where Elliot will be experimenting and testing different data sets. The goal of this project is to explore the vast world of data analysis and visualization, and to gain a deeper understanding of the tools and techniques used to work with data.

In this repository, you will find a variety of data sets that have been gathered from different sources. Elliot will be using these data sets to experiment with different techniques for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data. The ultimate goal is to gain a better understanding of the data and to uncover any hidden insights or patterns that might be present.

We hope that others who are interested in data analysis and visualization will find this repository to be a valuable resource. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to Elliot.

Enjoy exploring the data sets!
